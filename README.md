# Single-cell long-read RNA sequencing of human lung tissues

This repo includes the code to analyze the single-cell long-read dataset of lung tissues as part of manuscript "Single-cell full-length transcriptome of human lung reveals genetic effects on isoform regulation beyond gene-level expression".

The findings (i.e., isoform structure, isoform expression across lung cell types, and isoQTLs) in our paper could also be found and visulized via [ISOLUTION](https://appshare.cancer.gov/ISOLUTION)

## Analysis
### [isoQTL](https://github.com/NCI-ChoiLab/Lung_scLong_read_isoQTL/tree/main/Analysis/isoQTL)
For isoQTL mapping, we utilized negative binomial model by [jaxQTL](https://github.com/mancusolab/jaxqtl) to adress the sparsity of isoform expression. To determine the cell type specificity of isoQTL, [mashr EZ mode](https://github.com/NCI-ChoiLab/Lung_scLong_read_isoQTL/tree/main/Analysis/isoQTL/mashr) was used to harmonize the effect size. For functional annotation, we performed enrichment analysis of isoQTL in RNA-binding protein motifs (downloaded from [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/metadata/?type=PublicationData&%40id=%2Fpublication-data%2FENCSR456FVU%2F&files.preferred_default=true)). Our [single-cell multiome data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52356-9#Sec33) was also integrated with isoQTL and alternative splicing of isoforms.GWAS integration was performed by coloc and FUSION TWAS. Using our cell-barcode-matched short-read dataset, colocalization of sc-isoQTLs and eQTLs revealed the regulatory mechanism and GWAS contribution of isoQTL independent from eQTL.
### [Long-read integration](https://github.com/NCI-ChoiLab/Lung_scLong_read_isoQTL/tree/main/Analysis/Long-read%20integration)
This pipeline includes single-cell long-read data processing by ISO-seq, isoform integration across 22 single-cell batches by TALON, and further QC for protein-coding potential of novel isoforms by TransDecoder.
### [single-cell](https://github.com/NCI-ChoiLab/Lung_scLong_read_isoQTL/tree/main/Analysis/sinlge-cell)
Single cell data were asigned to specific individuals using genotype-based demultiplexing by vireoSNP. The code for single-cell process is all included in this folder. 
Differentially expression isoform (DEI) detection is described in [6.1.Isoform_sugnature_DEI_detect.R](https://github.com/NCI-ChoiLab/Lung_scLong_read_isoQTL/blob/main/Analysis/sinlge-cell/6.1.Isoform_signature_DEI_detect.R), and the benchmarking ofr isoform-level clustering and annotation can be found in [6.3.Clustering_annotation_w_isoform_expr.R](https://github.com/NCI-ChoiLab/Lung_scLong_read_isoQTL/blob/main/Analysis/sinlge-cell/6.3.Clustering_annotation_w_isoform_expr.R).
